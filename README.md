# Tic Tac Touch üé≤

Tic Tac Touch is a mobile game developed with Flutter, featuring the minimax algorithm to deliver an engaging Tic-Tac-Toe experience.

## Description üîç

Tic Tac Touch is an offline mobile game that provides players with the opportunity to indulge in the timeless classic of Tic-Tac-Toe. Players can face off against another human player or challenge themselves against three distinct AI difficulty levels.

Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an 'X' or an 'O' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.

The game's AI provides three distinct difficulty levels: 'Easy', where it makes random moves to available grid squares; 'Medium', which avoids random moves but still commits occasional errors; and finally, 'Impossible', where victory for the player is virtually impossible.

In conclusion, Tic Tac Touch's primary objective is to offer users an enjoyable experience while playing Tic-Tac-Toe through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

 ### Play Screen

 Once you've made your choice, whether it's 'vs Player' or a specific difficulty level for "vs Computer", you'll be taken to the play screen. Here, you'll find:

 - Player Information: This area displays whose turn it is, either "X's Turn" or "O's Turn" in the case of a two-player game. In 'vs Computer' mode, it will show "Your Turn" or "Computer's Turn" accordingly.

 - Game Board: The Tic-Tac-Toe grid where you make your moves by tapping on empty cells. Your moves are marked with 'X', and the opponent's moves with 'O'.

 - 'Exit' Button: You can use this button to exit the game and return to the home screen at any time.

 When the game ends, whether in a win, lose, or draw, the result will be displayed in the area that previously showed whose turn it was. Additionally, the 'Exit' button is replaced by a row of two buttons:

 - 'Play Again': Allows you to start a new game with the same settings.

 - 'Exit': Takes you back to the home screen.
